  <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About STABLE</h1>
  <p>
    Founded 33 years ago, Stable began as a humble horse rental service dedicated to supporting quality breeding. In our early days, our founders recognized that every horse had a unique story and potential – not only as a companion but as a vital contributor to the legacy of equine excellence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, we built a reputation for carefully matching horses with trusted breeders, ensuring that the best bloodlines and traditions were maintained. Our passion for horses and our commitment to excellence made us the go-to service for horse enthusiasts and professional breeders alike.

  <p>
    Today, Stable has evolved into a modern platform that makes it easy for anyone to become a renter or rent a horse for breeding. Our digital marketplace bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, allowing horse lovers and breeders to connect seamlessly. Whether you're a seasoned breeder or new to the world of horses, Stable is here to help you take the next step in your equine journey.
